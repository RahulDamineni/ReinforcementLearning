    "    * Gym is an OpenAI platform which provides easy access to various environments. \n",
    "    * Environment (of a game) will have attributes such as `action_space`, `observation_space` & `reward_range`\n",
    "    * We use `step()` method to advance environment when a particular action is chosen\n",
    "    * `step()` returns four outputs; observation, reward, done, info\n",
    "        > Observation is `Discrete`/ `Box` object which gives info about what state env is in currently \n",
    "        > Reward is what we achieved after action\n",
    "        > Done will be true if the env reaches its end state\n",
    "        > Info contains metadata\n",
    "        \n",
